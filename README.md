# EduTutor AI – Personalized Learning with Generative AI

## 📌 Project Overview
EduTutor AI is an intelligent educational assistant that provides students and learners with dynamic, personalized learning tools. By leveraging **IBM's Granite generative AI models**, the assistant explains complex concepts in simple terms and generates customized quizzes for self-assessment.  

The goal is to bridge the gap between static learning materials and interactive, adaptive education — making studying more engaging and effective.

## 🚀 Features
### 🔹 Concept Explanation
- **Key Point:** Simplifies complex topics.  
- **Functionality:** Users can input any concept (e.g., *full stack development*, *machine learning*) and receive an easy-to-understand explanation generated by AI.  

### 🔹 Interactive Quiz Generator
- **Key Point:** Personalized knowledge assessment.  
- **Functionality:** Automatically generates quizzes in multiple formats (MCQs, True/False, Fill-in-the-blank).  

### 🔹 Adaptive Learning
- **Key Point:** Tailored educational content.  
- **Functionality:** Explanations and quizzes are dynamically generated based on user input.  

### 🔹 User-Friendly Gradio Interface
- **Key Point:** Accessible and intuitive platform.  
- **Functionality:** Clean web interface with text inputs and tabbed outputs.

## 🏗️ Architecture
1. **Frontend (Gradio):**  
   - Provides a simple text box and tabs for Explanation & Quiz.  
   - Focused on clarity and ease of use.  

2. **Backend (Google Colab):**  
   - Python handles user input, constructs prompts, and processes outputs.  

3. **AI Model (IBM Granite via Hugging Face):**  
   - Uses `ibm-granite/granite-3.2-2b-instruct` for generating explanations and quizzes.  

4. **Deployment (Public Gradio Link):**  
   - Hosted via Google Colab with a temporary public link.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Google account (for Colab access)  
- Internet connection  
- Hugging Face account  

### Installation
1. Open **Google Colab** and create a new notebook.  
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   !pip install transformers torch gradio -q
   ```

```bash
   EduTutorAI/
│── edututor_ai.ipynb   # Main Colab notebook
│── requirements.txt    # (Optional) project dependencies
```
```bash
gradio
transformers
torch
 ```

## ▶️ Running the Application
1. Open **`edututor_ai.ipynb`** in Google Colab.  
2. Run the first cell (install libraries).  
3. Run the subsequent cells (load model + build interface).  
4. The final cell outputs a **public Gradio link** (e.g., `https://12345.gradio.live`).  
5. Open the link → Enter a concept → Click **Explain** or **Generate Quiz**.

EduTutor AI interacts with the Hugging Face API.  

- **Input Examples:**  
  - `"Explain the concept of Full Stack Development"`  
  - `"Generate a quiz on the topic of Machine Learning"`  

- **Output:**  
  - AI-generated **explanation** OR **structured quiz questions + answers**.

## 🔐 Authentication
- **Current Version:** No authentication required (public access).  
- **Future Plans:**  
  - Hugging Face API tokens for secure access.  
  - User login system for progress tracking.  

---

## 🧪 Testing
- **Unit Testing:** Verified explanations & quizzes for accuracy.  
- **UI Testing:** Tested Gradio input/output usability.  
- **Model Testing:** Refined prompts to improve AI outputs.  

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- Responses may be verbose or slightly inaccurate.  
- Quiz formatting may vary.  
- Public Colab links expire after inactivity.  
- Performance may lag without GPU.  

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Add **difficulty levels** for quizzes (Beginner / Intermediate / Expert).  
- Implement **user accounts** (save history & scores).  
- Support **image-based inputs** (diagrams, charts).  
- Add **text-to-speech** for auditory learners.  
- Deploy on **Hugging Face Spaces** for 24/7 access.  
- Fine-tune the model with **academic datasets**.
